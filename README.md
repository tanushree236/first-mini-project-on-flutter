Mini Project on flutter

A new Flutter project.

## Getting Started

This is my first flutter project.

This project is a starting point for a Flutter application.

This mini project shows the time of a particular place for example Kolkata and also shows if it is day time or night time according to the time of the place.
You can also see the time of different countries as mentioned in the Edit locations.

The concepts that I have learnt from this project about Flutter are:
    -> Basics of the language Dart which is used in Flutter
    ->Different types of widgets like Scaffold, AppBar, SafeArea, Container, Text, Column, Row, Button, Icons, Expanded widget ......
    >Text Styles :Colour, font
    ->Stateless and StateFull Widgets and its difference
    ->Lists of data
    ->Asynchronous operations
    ->http package
    ->World Time API (which helps to get time of different places)
    ->List view Builder

All the concepts have been applied in this project.

This project is a learning based project.

I had a great learning experience doing this mini project.
